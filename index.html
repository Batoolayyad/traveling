                what traveling add to your life
            </h2>
              <p class="introduction">
                  There is no greater feeling than having your bags packed and knowing you’re ready to go on your next adventure. There are few things in life that will impact you as much as traveling will. Something happens to us when we board a plane in one country and land in another—it’s almost as if our eyes open again for the first time. The excitement and life experiences that happen when you travel are unlike anything else. It’s hard to capture in words the moment when you see the sunset behind the Colosseum in Rome or when you finally can understand what someone is saying in another language. These moments are transformative; they take us out of our element and remind us of why we are here. Here are two main reasons traveling will change your life.

        <div class="contant">  
            <ul >
            <div class="first">                
                <h3>
                 You broaden your perspective.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Nothing changes the way you view your own life experience like seeing the way other people live. Not only will you be more appreciative and thankful for the life you have, you’ll also have a new sense of wonder and empathy for other cultures and countries. Soak in the language, the lifestyle and what people in foreign countries value—you’ll realize it’s different everywhere in the world and it will undoubtedly make you evaluate your own values.                  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="second" > 
                 <h3>
                 You learn to live in the moment.
                </h3> 
                <p> 
                    Whether you are seeing the canals of Venice for the first time or the pyramids of Egypt, traveling teaches you to take in the moment of awe and make the most of it. Traveling is a feast for your eyes and it makes you stop and live in that second, minute and moment. It’s hard to be thinking about your latest text message when you’re half way across the world visiting places you’ve never been to before and seeing spots you’ve only read about. Traveling teaches us to unplug, explore and discover new parts of ourselves.
